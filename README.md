# project-euler-rust

I solved some problems from Project Euler while learning Rust.  
I make the problems more general in order to test them with the examples given with the problem statement.  
ex: p003

- 'Find largest prime factor' instead of
- 'What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?'
