Here are my solutions to some problems from Project Euler.
I tried to make the problem statements more general in order to test my solutions. Those tests usually come from the examples given.
ex: p003

- 'Find largest prime factor of n' instead of
- 'What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?'
